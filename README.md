# Parcel Mate - Parcel Identification and Route Planning App
Parcel Mate is a reliable parcel identification and route planning app built with React and Google Maps. It provides real-time updates and easy route planning to help keep track of deliveries efficiently. This app is perfect for small business owners or personal use and is PWA enabled.

## Features
The key features of Parcel Mate are:

1. Real-time parcel tracking and identification: The app offers real-time parcel location updates and allows users to record identification details like color, size, and type to easily locate specific parcels in delivery vehicles.

2. Easy route planning: The app allows for easy route planning and optimization, making it simple to manage delivery routes. Users can use the Google Maps Directions API to optimize routes for up to 25 locations or plan the route themselves using an integrated Google Map and waypoints to generate the route.

3. Streamlined data entry: The app's 2-step form for delivery and parcel information is faster than traditional pen and paper methods. User can input addresses directly or upload a CSV file for faster entry. The app uses Google Maps for geocaching and prioritizes the closest match within an uploaded CSV list.

4. PWA enabled: The app is Progressive Web App enabled, offering benefits such as offline access, fast loading, and app-like experience on any device with a web browser, improving user experience and accessibility.

5. Built with React & Google Maps: Parcel Mate is developed with React, delivering a smooth user experience and ensuring fast, efficient performance. Integrating with Google Maps API provides powerful functionality, such as real-time tracking updates and optimized route planning. The combination of these technologies also enhances the developer experience, making it easier to create, test and deploy new features and improvements.
